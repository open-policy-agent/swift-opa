    /// 1. If a `capabilities.json` is supplied, it ensures that all builtins required by the
    ///    policies are declared in the capabilities file, including their full signatures.
    /// 2. It validates that each required builtin name exists in the provided `builtins`
    ///    dictionary (default or custom). Signatures are not checked hereâ€”argument validation
    ///    occurs only at runtime inside the builtin implementation.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - capabilities: Optional input specifying the OPA capabilities to validate against.

    ///   - builtins: A mapping of builtin names to their implementations available in Swift.

    ///   - `RegoError.capabilitiesMissingBuiltin` if the capabilities file does not list all
    ///     required builtins.
